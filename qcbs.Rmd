# Two challenges for Canadian biodiversity science

---

class: inverse, center, middle

# Challenge #1
# A lack of accessible, organized biodiversity data

---

## - Difficult to assess current biodiversity

--

## - Difficult to make decisions about the future

--

## - Difficult for stakeholders to make decisions

---

class: inverse, center, middle

# Challenge #2
# Adopting modern computational approaches in biodiversity science

---

## - Academic biodiversity science is increasingly multidisciplinary

--

## - Students increasingly seek for computational & communication skills

--

## - Employers look for them too!

# Introducing the BIOS<sup>2</sup> Fellows!
## An NSERC CREATE program

---
# The BIOS<sup>2</sup> program trains biodiversity scientists in modern computational methods

## There are two main components to this training:

--
### 1. Training modules from top Canadian biodiversity scientists

--

### 2. Paid internships within our Partner organizations
